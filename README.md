# Customer Churn Analysis ‚Äì Telecom Dataset

This repository contains my **first data analysis project using Python**, where I explored a telecom customer churn dataset to uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior.

## üìä Project Overview

The goal of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) was to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

This project was completed using the following tools:

| Tool        | Description                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Python      | Programming language for analysis   |
| Pandas      | Data manipulation and preprocessing |
| NumPy       | Numerical computing                 |
| Matplotlib  | Data visualization                  |
| Seaborn     | Statistical data visualization      |
| JupyterLab  | Interactive coding environment      |

## üîç Key Insights

- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** are over **4x more likely** to churn than those with two-year contracts.
- **Senior citizens** and customers **without support services** (tech support, security) show significantly higher churn.
- Payment methods like **electronic checks** and services like **fiber optic internet** correlate with higher churn rates.
- Customers with **low tenure** and **high monthly charges** are more likely to leave.

## üß† What I Learned

As this was my **first Python project**, I learned:
- How to structure a data analysis notebook
- Cleaning and transforming real-world datasets
- Extracting insights using grouped statistics and visualizations
- Communicating results clearly through storytelling and graphs
