# Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Dataset

This repository contains my **first data analysis project using Python**, where I explored a telecom customer churn dataset to uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) was to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Pandas** – data wrangling and manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Seaborn** – advanced statistical plots

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** are over **4x more likely** to churn than those with two-year contracts.
- **Senior citizens** and customers **without support services** (tech support, security) show significantly higher churn.
- Payment methods like **electronic checks** and services like **fiber optic internet** correlate with higher churn rates.
- Customers with **low tenure** and **high monthly charges** are more likely to leave.
